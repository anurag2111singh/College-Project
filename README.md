# Tomato Plant Health Analysis
Tomatoes are a staple in global agriculture, contributing significantly to nutrition and culinary traditions. 
However, tomato farming faces persistent threats from diseases, pests, and adverse environmental conditions, causing economic losses and affecting food security. 
Maintaining plant health is crucial,
as early detection and management of diseases like blight and bacterial spots can minimize crop losses, enhance productivity, and promote sustainable agriculture.
The growing demand for tomatoes underscores the need for intelligent monitoring systems integrating IoT and ML technologies. IoT sensors, such as those for soil moisture, temperature, and humidity, provide real-time environmental data, while advanced ML models like vision transformers enable precise disease detection from leaf images. 
These technologies empower farmers with actionable insights, improving agricultural practices and crop quality.
Beyond tomatoes, IoT and ML applications in agriculture optimize resource usage and farming efficiency. While convolutional neural networks (CNNs) are widely used for plant disease detection, vision transformers offer enhanced accuracy and robustness. Cloud computing further supports real-time data processing and predictive insights.
Challenges like high computational costs and limited accessibility in remote areas must be addressed through collaborative efforts to ensure scalable, inclusive solutions.
